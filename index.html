               By using natural cosmetics you are not only benefiting your body but doing something good for the environment too! The products that we have curated are free from harmful chemical cocktails and microplastics and contain high-quality organic oils and raw plant materials that are largely organically grown.

                We follow exceptionally strict guidelines when it comes to reviewing a brand - without compromise. A brand is not added to our selection if it does not fulfil the natural cosmetics standards, no matter how high in demand it may be. Occasionally, the composition or formulas of individual products are modified. In such cases, the products are reviewed once more to ensure that natural cosmetic standards are still met.

                We are very cautious when it comes to brands that develop both conventional as well as natural products. At Ecco Verde, such brands are far and few. If so, we only list the products that are truly natural. That being said, we do lean toward forgoing the acquisition of brands that offer such a product catalogue.

                Large, bright golden yellow, round to slightly flattened juicy fruit, have attractively lobed and bulged sections, without splitting. With few seeds and a large core, it has a strong, tangy, slightly acidic-fruity flavour, with a hint of citrus. It is productive for a long time, and matures quite early for such a large tomato, this being one of the better large yellow varieties, and it comes highly recommended.

               This heavy cropping variety is everyone's favourite, producing seemingly endless bunches of smallish, ultra-sweet fruits, which resemble large, shiny, dark brown cherries and which have a very rich flavour.

                This natural and stabilized cross between Green Zebra and a black tomato is one of the stars of the new tomato range available. The quarter pound juicy round tomatoes have purple/mahogany-coloured skin with green stripes.

           We are one of the few seed companies in the world who still grow and produce many of our own seeds. We supply numerous seed companies, trade customers and nurseries worldwide. We believe all seeds are correctly named. As these are sometimes open pollinated, occasional variations may occur and we cannot be held responsible other than for replacement of seeds.Very rarely mistakes can happen. In this event we always strive to be as understanding and generous as possible. However, we regret that our liability is limited to the replacement of the seeds or refund of the cost of the seeds at the customer's discretion.
